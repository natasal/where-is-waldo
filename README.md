# Where-is-Waldo
This is a project that Leah (https://github.com/lgaetano) and I tackled during our mini-hackaton in our Convolutional Neural Networks class in December 2019: https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/welcome

We wanted to build a machine learning model that would find Waldo in given images.

We've built our model using transfer learning with inception neural network and drawn our dataset from the color images available in vc1492a's "Hey Waldo" image repository.

As far as the results, our networks were not able to find Waldo: there were too many non-Waldo images, and not enough Waldo images (and the networks were overfitting) and we needed a different approach.  To make this project work in the future, we need to use object recognition and combine it with transfer learning.

Our project was recognized at the end of hackaton for the best presentation.

See our presentation pdf for more details about the project:
